<h3> Assignment 3 </h3>
<hr>
### Intro:
This assignment contains an implementation for gradient descent.
### Dependencies:
It makes use of numpy and pandas and python3
###Graphs:
The graphs are generated after running the code for the gradient descent.
### Caveat:
We have made use of normalization to reduce the number of iterations required to make the algorithm converge.
### Note: 
Keep in mind the location of the files which have been hardcoded to obtain the raw data for the regression.

<h3> Assignment 4 </h3>
<hr>
### Intro
This assignment contains an implementation of the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm which was used to predict the concentration of two sizes of particles for the year 2017 based on the concentration of air constituents in Madrid city in 2016.
### Dependencies:
It makes use of numpy and pandas and python3
### Note: 
The datasheets need to be present in the same folder as the program
