# Data_Science_Assignment
## Assignment 1
<p> The objective of this assignment is to find the posterior of a distribution based on a set of data points. Here, we have made use of the bernoulli distribution, which makes use of the beta distribution as the prior. In addition, we have made use of the mean to be 0.4 in the beta distribution</p>

## Assignment 2
<p> The objective of this assignment is to find the value of PI with the help of Mote-Carlo simulations. Here we have estimated the value for 10^1,10^2...10^7. <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that the system being used has atleast 16 GB RAM to run the program.</p>
